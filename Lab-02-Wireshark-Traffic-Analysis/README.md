# Lab 02 - Wireshark Traffic Analysis

## Objective

Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to understand core protocols and identify common network communication patterns.

## Environment

- Windows host system
- VMware Workstation
- Wireshark
- Ethernet network interface

## Protocols Analyzed

- DNS
- TCP
- TLS

## Tasks Performed

- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Identified DNS queries and responses
- Reviewed domain name resolution activity
- Analyzed the TCP three-way handshake
- Identified SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets
- Reviewed TLS 1.3 ClientHello and ServerHello traffic
- Identified Server Name Indication (SNI) values where visible
- Reviewed common source and destination ports

## Key Findings

The capture demonstrated how DNS resolves domain names before communication begins.

TCP traffic showed the standard three-way handshake process used to establish a reliable connection.

TLS traffic demonstrated encrypted session establishment while still exposing selected connection metadata such as IP addresses, ports, and SNI values.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Packet capture analysis
- Wireshark filtering
- DNS investigation
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- TLS traffic analysis
- Network troubleshooting
- SOC network analysis fundamentals

## Evidence

Supporting screenshots and the complete lab report are included in this folder.

## Safety Note

Only traffic from the user's own controlled lab and local network environment was analyzed.
